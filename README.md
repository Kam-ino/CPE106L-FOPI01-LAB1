PP1 (Guevarra, Carrido)
Statisticians would like to have a set of functions to compute the median and mode of a list of numbers.
The median is the number that would appear at the midpoint of a list if it were sorted. The mode is the 
number that appears most frequently in the list.Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also 
include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. Each function expects a 
list of numbers as an argument and returns a single number.

PP2 (Tayco, Torralba, Galang)
Write a program that allows the user to navigate through the lines of text in a file. The program prompts 
the user for a filename and inputs the lines of text into a list. The program then enters a loop in which 
it prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. Actual line numbers 
range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the 
program prints the line associated with that number.9
